# FullStack JavaScript Project 6 Node.JS Scraper

* Create a scraper.js file that will contain your command line application.
* Program your scraper so that it visits the website http://shirts4mike.com and uses http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php as single entry point to scrape information for 8 tee-shirts from the site
* The scraper should get the price, title, url and image url from the product page and save this information into a CSV file
* If http://shirts4mike.com is down, an error message describing the issue should appear in the console
* When an error occurs, log it to a file named scraper-error.log
